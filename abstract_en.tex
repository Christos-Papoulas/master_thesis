\end{center}

\indent In this work we propose a Social Network Platform, both front-end and back-end technology, for model-driven software design and deployment of applications in Multi-cloud environments. Nowadays, DevOps users, especially cloud deployment specialists, wander around the web looking for automated tools like Chef supermarket, IBM bluemix and other deployment tools where they almost manually configure and deploy their applications without any help from a community-sourced information repository. The users, inside of the proposed social network, can create their own Cloud Application Modelling and Execution
Language models or benefit from automatically generated models. We provide a Platform with an integrated community helping the DevOps users to design and deploy their applications and a repository of execution histories of applications. We incentivize user to stay inside the Platform instead of roaming around the web looking for other Q\&A sites like StackOverflow to find their answers. The information about the runtime executions of applications can be uploaded and analysed by the Platform presenting cost effectiveness analysis. In addition, Natural language Processing tools are integrated with the Platform in order to identify the context of users questions and provide automated answers. A scalable front-end is implemented using multiple front-end nodes and a powerful back-end system is implemented using caching technologies.
