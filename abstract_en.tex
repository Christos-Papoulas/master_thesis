\end{center}

\indent In this work we propose a Social Network Platform, both front-end and back-end technology, for model-driven software design and deployment of applications in Multi-cloud environments. Nowadays, DevOps users wander around the web for automated tools like Chef supermarket, IBM bluemix and other deployment tools where almost manually configure and deploy their applications without any model-driven concept. The users can create their own Cloud Application Modeling and Execution
Language models or benefit from automatically generated models. We provide a Platform with an integrated community helping the DevOps users to deploy their applications. We incentivize user to stay inside the Platform instead of travel around the web for other Q\&A sites like StackOverflow to find their answers. The runtime executions of applications can be uploaded and analysed by the Platform presenting cost effectiveness analysis.
