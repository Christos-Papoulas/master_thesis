\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This thesis describes and evaluates a scalable social networking architecture for DevOps engineers, with a special focus on cloud deployment specialists. The scalability of the architecture relies on the provisioning of multiple Social Networking Engine instances at the front end, and/or several Memcached nodes at the back end of the system. Users of the social networking platform can benefit from the community knowledge and from the CAMEL repository of application models and executions, to improve the configuration, the deployment and the
optimization of distributed multi-cloud applications, tasks of major interest to cloud deployment specialists. The design of our professional network applied best practices aiming to support the creation of a vigorous community, to allow users to retrieve timely and appropriate information and to carry out actions in the minimum number of steps.
