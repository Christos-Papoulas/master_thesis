\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this thesis, a scalable social network architecture for cloud deployment specialists is presented. The scaling of the system, using known techniques, is implemented at the front end layer by introducing more than one social networking engine instances, and/or at the back end of the system by introducing more than one memcached nodes. 
The DevOps users of the Social Network can benefit from the community knowledge and from the CAMEL repository of application models and executions, to improve the configuration, the deployment and the optimization of distributed multi-cloud applications, tasks of major interest to cloud deployment specialists. 
Furthermore, a topic classification tool is introduced in our platform which enables the categorization of user's input from the community. 

The user evaluations and the pilot use of our platform within the PaaSage project are helped to improve our implementation. As future work, we believe in further integrating our platform with the PaaSage ecosystem, by better communicating with the PaaSage repository and the PaaSage components such as execution ware.
